            Inazuman samurai society often revolves around an honor system of sorts; samurai families, being relatively common in Inazuma, have an immense amount of pride and honor, often sending their children to serve in the Shogun's armies to glory and fame. Samurai are known to engage in duels from time to time. They are particularly prideful of their own skills; being bested in battle or duel by another or being helped by an outsider is typically considered to be shameful.
